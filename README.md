## Simulations

This report and the associated code was written for the University of Victoria course CSC446: Simulations. The intention of this course was to explore and learn discrete event simulation and to perform statistical analysis of the data retreived.

The report is a term project and is a simulated study of the effectiveness of a priority queueing router in order to alleviate reordering packets at the destination. Code used for the simulation is provided in this repository.
